        <h2>What is TCP/IP?</h2>
        <p>
            TCP/IP stands for Transmission control protocol and is suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network -- an intranet or extranet.<br> It specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination.In 1998 first protocol was developed by IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) known as IPv6.

   <section id="Working">
    <h2>Working:</h2>
     <p> TCP/IP uses the client-server model of communication in which a user or machine -- a client -- is provided a service, such as sending a webpage, by another computer -- a server -- in the network.<br>Collectively, the TCP/IP suite of protocols is classified as stateless, which means each client request is considered new because it's unrelated to previous requests. Being stateless frees up network paths so they can be used continuously.<br> The transport layer itself, however, is stateful. It transmits a single message and its connection remains in place until all the packets in a message have been received and reassembled at the destination.<br></p>

   <section id="Importance">
    <h2> Importance:</h2>
    <p>TCP/IP is the fundamental protocol suite that enables data transfer and communication across the internet and other networks.<br> It's nonproprietary and, as a result, isn't controlled by any single company.<br> Therefore, the IP suite can be modified easily. <br>It's compatible with all operating systems (OSes), so it can communicate with any other system.<br> The IP suite is also compatible with all types of computer hardware and networks.<br> TCP/IP is highly scalable and, as a routable protocol, can determine the most efficient path through the network.<br> It's widely used in current internet architecture. </p>
   </section>

   <section id="Pros/cons">
    <h2> Pros:</h2>
    <p>The advantages of using the TCP/IP model include the following:</p><br><p>It helps establish a connection between different types of computers.
        It works independently of the OS.<br>
        TCP/IP supports many routing protocols.<br>
        It uses a client-server architecture that's highly scalable.<br>
        TCP/IP can be operated independently.<br>
        It supports several routing protocols.<br>
        It's lightweight and doesn't place unnecessary strain on a network or computer.</p><h2>Cons:</h2><p>The disadvantages of TCP/IP include the following:</p><br><p>It's complicated to set up and manage.<br>
            The transport layer doesn't guarantee the delivery of packets.<br>
            It isn't easy to replace protocols in TCP/IP.<br>
            It doesn't clearly separate the concepts of services, interfaces and protocols, so it isn't suitable for describing new technologies in new networks.<br>
            It's especially vulnerable to synchronization attacks, which are a type of denial-of-service attack in which a bad actor uses TCP/IP.</p>

    <section id="Applications">
      <h2>What Are TCP/IP Application Services?</h2>
      <p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the fundamental communication protocol suite for the internet and most local networks. TCP/IP Application Services refer to the various protocols and services that operate at the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model.</p>
      <p>These services help users interact with the internet or other networks via applications that enable communication, file transfer, remote login, email exchanges, and more.</p>
      <h3>Common TCP/IP Application Services:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP/HTTPS</li>

      </ul>
    </section>
<img src="SMTP.png">


    <section id="ftp">
      <h2>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h2>
      <p>FTP is used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network. It allows users to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers.</p>
      <h3>Uses:</h3>
      <p>Transferring large files and managing website files.</p>
      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reliable for transferring large files.</li>
        <li>Can resume interrupted file transfers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>FTP sends data in plaintext, making it insecure without encryption (like FTPS or SFTP).</li>
        <li>Requires proper authentication and security configurations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
<img src="FTP.png">


    <section id="dns">
      <h2>DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
      <p>DNS translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate on the internet.</p>
      <h3>Uses:</h3>
      <p>Enabling users to access websites using human-readable domain names rather than numerical IP addresses.</p>
      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplifies internet navigation by allowing users to use domain names.</li>
        <li>Highly scalable and distributed system.</li>
